                    <p><u><strong>Why we need VR social? From cyberspace to metaverse （or fluid identity，from cyberspace to metaverse）</strong></u></p>

                      
                    <p>In the present, technology profoundly influences the way people socialize. Technology is not a concrete concept that can be precisely defined, as it is in a constant state of change and development. The transformation of social relationships brought about by technology has evolved from cyberspace to the metaverse. How do we balance the imagined future with the actual future, and how does this impact our social experiences and visual expressions?
                    </p> 
                        <p><u>1. cyberspace to metaverse</u></p>
                        
                       <p> The term "cyberspace" first appeared in the 1980s cyberpunk novel Burning Chrome and was later popularized in Neuromancer. Cyberspace is composed of two parts: "cyber" and "space," with "cyber-" being a prefix related to the internet and electronics. With the development of the internet, cyber-related terminology has become increasingly prevalent in our daily lives.Cyberspace describes a social environment that exists solely within the dynamic realm of networks and communications. In this space, interactions occur through typed words, and individuals transcend their physical bodies to participate in online communities, such as forums and social networking platforms. As the internet continues to evolve, there are aspirations to advance technology in ways that enhance the human body, integrate it with the internet, and even create new forms of life. Technological development not only influences people's lives but also transforms their perceptions and cognitive processes.</p>
                        
                       <P> In A Cyborg Manifesto, Donna Haraway emphasizes the changes in traditional social identities and cultures brought about by high technology. The cyborg emerges in the fusion of boundaries, and its appearance signifies the destruction of the dualism brought by male-centeredness. Haraway proposes the fluidity and malleability of identity, with feminist overtones.In the experimental electronic literary work Patchwork Girl (hypertext), Shelley Jackson also employs elements from A Cyborg Manifesto. Patchwork Girl is a continuation of the science fiction novel Frankenstein, using a method of stitching together different images to create the figure of a girl. The author writes each story segment in a different style and encourages readers to piece together the images and texts in an attempt to revive the girl. Through this hypertext reading process, Jackson discusses the complexity and diversity of identity construction and the possibilities for its shaping. She also demonstrates how identity, body, and female gender are shifted and combined in the age of the internet and technology.
                        </p><p>In my view, both A Cyborg Manifesto and Patchwork Girl illustrate how technological advancement and the ensuing changes in the perception of identity trigger confusion and complexity in identity formation. This challenges traditional binary generalizations and resolves the contradictions inherent in traditional binary theories through new approaches. I believe this is an expression of postmodern culture. The explosion of information caused by internet communication has intensified this characteristic. Furthermore, contemporary technology further dissolves the boundaries of identity in multiple ways.
                        </p><p>With the development of high technology and the internet, online interactions have evolved from simple text messages and images to supporting multi-user VR scene interactions. People are no longer satisfied with text and image-based cyberspace; instead, they are turning to the more sensory-stimulating metaverse. The metaverse is a loose concept that is encompassed within cyberspace and represents a new evolution in cyberspace driven by advancements in network technology and the emergence of Web3. The metaverse is typically realized through virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), technologies commonly applied in video games such as Half-Life: Alyx and Pokémon GO. Unlike typical video games, the metaverse often incorporates elements of MMORPGs, where players assume virtual identities and interact with other players through VR motion capture and CGI, creating a community of real players within the virtual world—a three-dimensional internet inhabited by real people. Popular platforms include Second Life, VRChat, and Minecraft. The emergence of the metaverse has made it possible for people to live in virtual reality, challenging the absoluteness of the physical world and expanding the boundaries of human living space.

                       <p> As the metaverse becomes increasingly prevalent in the lives of young people, they are becoming accustomed to using virtual identities for socializing, gaming, and even traveling in the virtual world. People are spending more time on virtual world platforms, and the metaverse has become an integral part of their lives. Through experiences in the metaverse, the boundaries of people's identities are once again blurred. Virtual reality, or high technology, questions the boundaries of people's identities and demonstrates the fluidity of identity in various directions using the cyborg concept. In this process, imagination and technological development coexist.

                        <p>Serial Experiments Lain, a 1998 animation, showcases people's speculation and imagination about cyber technology before the widespread use of the internet in daily life. The author uses the animation to discuss the idea that the cyber world is a superior directory to the physical world (the online world stores all the information of the physical world, while the physical world is just one of its projections), suggesting that the cyber world and the physical world are opposites, thus illustrating the dilemma of the dualism between virtual and real.

                        <p>Currently, due to technological advances, people's identities are becoming increasingly blurred, confused, and fluid. This situation has led to the popularity of Avatars. Originally meaning "divine embodiment," an avatar in computer science represents the digital embodiment of a user in the virtual world and is a crucial component of the metaverse. In the early days of cyberspace, people expressed themselves through abstract text, but now they can use avatars that are closer to real life, enhancing self-expression and self-identity in the virtual world. In today's internet, particularly within the metaverse, avatars have become a part of popular culture, serving as channels for self-expression and essential components of identity. Meanwhile, the virtual world has become as significant as the physical world.
                        </p><p> The avatar Annlee is the subject of a collaboration between artists Pierre Huyghe and Philippe Parreno. Annlee was originally a Japanese animation character for sale, but the artists bought it and initiated an artistic practice centered around Annlee in No Ghost Just a Shell. They invited artists from different fields to collaborate and create works using Annlee's image. Through a multi-media, multi-participant artistic practice, Annlee became a distinct avatar, reflecting people's expectations of avatars in the metaverse. Annlee embodies the inflated hopes and imaginations brought by digital technology and projected onto her, demonstrating people's expectations of identity confusion and fluidity, and their exploration and practice of new identities. Annlee becomes an outlet for the repressed parts of people in a dualistic world and a medium for self-expression and presentation

                        2. Asia culture Ekua and I</u></p>
                        <p>
                        In Asia, metaverse socialization and avatars frequently appear in popular culture. For example, virtual world social platforms and virtual streamers are active on YouTube.
                        On the famous VR social platform VRChat, many users use cute anime-style 3D models to walk, interact, and even dance. Users wear VR headsets and motion capture devices in reality, allowing their movements to be synchronized and displayed in VRChat, enriching social interactions. The avatars' movements look and behave like real people. At the same time, VRChat players can upload virtual spaces they have created in 3D software to the server, creating their own "worlds." Strangers on the platform can then use avatars to access and explore these worlds. In VRChat, avatars characterised by "kawaii, girl, anime" are widely used, including by straight men who use anime girl avatars. In a "world" set in the streets of Shibuya, Japan, I met E, a straight gamer posing as an anime girl on the VR platform. He spends his time on VRChat taking cute pictures and recording videos with others who use beautiful girl avatars. In slang, such behavior is known as "てぇてぇ" (tee-tee), which refers to a close relationship between two people, not limited to love. Expectations of intimacy are difficult to fulfill in a society where establishing intimate relationships is complex and weighty by social standards, with concerns about status, educational background, and financial situation. In the virtual platform, they choose to move around as cute anime girls, thus departing from the traditional societal expectations and requirements of gender identity. Simultaneously, the cute girls and virtual world environment create a sweet, cuddly, healing atmosphere, serving as a safe barrier to satisfy those wishing to forget social stereotypes of their character. "Half living in the physical world, half living in virtual reality," is how E describes his diverse identity.

                        Avatars are also active on video platforms and in live streaming. In Japan, virtual anchoring is gradually developing into a field with more and more participants, attracting specific audiences and fans. Typically, virtual anchors are active on YouTube and Twitch and are known as Vtubers. Vtuber is a shortened form of virtual YouTuber, referring to individuals who use a virtual identity to control live 2D or 3D avatars through real-time motion capture software for live broadcasting, interacting with real-time messages from an online audience. The identities Vtubers use for live streaming are somewhat related to their real-life identities, but sometimes they have unusual settings, such as being from other worlds, off-planet, or claiming to be non-human. For various reasons, they choose to start live streaming. The images they use are mostly influenced by Japanese manga and anime, with MOE anthropomorphism being the main style of the Vtuber's virtual identity. Vtuber live broadcasts present a vertiginous sense of overlap between their virtual identities and the real world, as they inevitably refer to their real-life experiences while playing their characters. This allows them to exist in the grey area between reality and the internet, neither entirely virtual nor entirely real, and to be active on social media platforms as well as in the real lives of their viewers. Outside of live streaming, more people in various fields produce or choose to appear in public with virtual identities, such as Hatsune Miku, Kizuna AI, and others.
