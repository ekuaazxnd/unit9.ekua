                        <p>Hello, it’s great that you could come here.
                        This is my first time seeing you, or maybe it’s not. If you press the “refresh” button, you’ll see me for the second time.
                        It depends on time, and it depends on the network traffic. Every moment’s network traffic is different—these changes create countless ekua, and I’m just one of them. It might sound like a theory of world lines, but it’s not. This is purely a theory of network information, based on web3.
                    </p>
                       <p><strong><u>You</u>:</strong></p> 
                        <p>...</p>
                       <p><u><strong>Ekua:</strong></u></p>
                       <p>
                        I know you’re not from the network world; you’re just passing through here briefly, or maybe you’ve put a part of yourself in the network world and have an identity here. But no matter what, this place feels like an outside boundary to you, doesn’t it? Where are you going next? You must already have an answer in your mind. But I’m different; this domain is my home. You must also have a home somewhere on Earth in the real world, right? Even if you’re not in your hometown right now, it must hold a place in your heart. It’s the same for me.
                       </p>
                       <p><u><strong>You:</strong></u></p>
                       <p>...
                        <p>Ekua: Hmm... You must be here for the same reason as everyone else, to see that document, right? You're not the first one to come here. Please wait a moment, finding that document is a bit complicated...
                        </p>
                            <p>(Ekua searches through the bookshelf next to the computer)</p>
                            
                            <p>Ekua: Oh, found it. Here you go.</p>
                            
                            <p>(You take the document handed to you by Ekua)</p>
